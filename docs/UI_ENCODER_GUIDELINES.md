## Encoder Interaction Guidelines

These rules keep every encoder consistent:

- **Click to engage/cycle/neutral:** A click cycles the encoder’s discrete mode (with a neutral/off state where applicable). Use Perform (DIRECT/ARP/STRUM/PATTERN) as the model.
- **Turn/drag/wheel adjusts the active selection:** Once a function is engaged, wheel or drag adjusts its scoped value or cycles its infinite options.
- **Neutral/off exists:** Each encoder exposes a neutral/off mode (e.g., Perform → DIRECT; Key → OFF; Bass/Volume → 0 if applicable; FX lock OFF).
- **Types:** Encoders are either:
  - **Scoped (0–99 over 270°):** Volume, Bass, Perform value, BPM (mapped), FX level. Default step is coarse; holding **Shift** forces fine step (1 unit).
  - **Infinite:** Sound (patch browse), Key (root), Options (playstyle), Loop (future), FX type cycle.
- **Modifiers:** Hold **Shift** while scrolling/dragging to use fine increments (1). Hold **Shift** + click for secondary toggles (e.g., FX lock, key auto-chords, bass-volume gesture via Volume encoder).

Keep future encoders aligned with these rules.
